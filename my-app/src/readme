NOTE WHEN CODING TRY TO FUCK AROUND WITH TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE ESPECIALY WITH THE CSS. ITS VERY FINICKY. ALSO THERE ARE A FEW BUGS BUT FUCK IT.
NOTE MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE FILE PATHS ON YOUR SYSTEMS TO MAKE IT WORK LIKE MANGROVE IMAGE AND OTHERS 

All the files for front_page (css/html/js) & preload-webveiw.js are for the green home page with the Mangrove Logo. 
This file just acts as a home page and only has the search bar for now but we can extend it with pins and a setting page and what not (basically a google.com clone rn)
front_page.js gets the input and sends it to the parent via electrons tools.
Before you use inter process communication in electron you need to expose them using preload files (like setting them as public) and use the nodeIntegration flag.

This is how we load it in index.html:
    <webview id="webview" src="front_page.html" nodeIntegration preload="preload-webveiw.js"></webview>

index files (except index.js (index.js is not the source for index.html IDK why its designed like this but this is the default so i kept it.)) and renderer.js is the actual front end of the app (right now just the tool bar). 
renderer.js handles the javascript (some animation / tab location / tab management/ initialization) for the ui. This is the core of the app rn. 
For Renderer.js to work, you also got preload the files to expose electrons processes. 

index.js is kind of like the actual backend of the app. Not much happens here yet instead of just creating the app and handling signals and communications from the other proceses. 

Theres no need to touch rust rn
